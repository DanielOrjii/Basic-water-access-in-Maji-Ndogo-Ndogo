# Maji Ndogo Basic Access to Water

**Project Overview**

This is a comprehensive analysis to assess the current state of water supply in Maji Ndogo and identify areas needing improvement and also implement data-driven solutions to enhance water access for all residents. The dashboard aims to promote transparency in revenue usage, track expenses against the budget over time, and eliminate fund wastage. The dataset used was provided by ExploreAI for my final project.

**Analysis Process:**

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Gather detailed information on current water sources, including wells, public taps and taps in homes.
   - Collect data on water availability, quality, and distribution efficiency.

2. **Data Assessment:**
   - Ensured consistent column names and data types with each columns.
   - Identified and resolved errors in our table to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
   - Identify areas within Maji Ndogo that lack adequate access to clean water.
   - Determine the population affected and the specific challenges they face.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the collected data to pinpoint gaps in the water supply network.
   - Utilized DAX expressions to calculate various measures, including cumulative cost, percent progress, number of lives improved, and the population with basic access to water.

5. **Data Visualization:***
    -Built a Power BI dashboard to effectively visualize insights, track project progress, and monitor for budget mishandling.

**Findings:**
- Several regions in Maji Ndogo lack reliable access to clean water.
- Existing water infrastructure in certain areas is outdated or insufficient to meet current demands.

**Implementation of Solutions:**

1. **Building New Wells:**
   - Construct new wells in underserved areas to provide immediate access to water.
   - Ensure wells are strategically located to maximize benefit and reach the largest number of residents.
   - Ensure public wells are effecively spread across each province to reduce travel times for water supply.

2. **Improving Existing Structures:**
   - Upgrade and repair existing water supply structures, including wells and public taps.
   - Enhance water purification and filtration systems to ensure the water quality meets health standards.

3. **Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Establish a system for regular monitoring of water sources and infrastructure.
   - Implement maintenance schedules to prevent deterioration and ensure continuous water supply.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved access to clean water for all residents of Maji Ndogo.
- Enhanced reliability and efficiency of the water supply network.
- Data-driven insights facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation.

**Conclusion:**

The water crisis in Maji Ndogo has intensified due to corruption and the mismanagement of public funds. This project aims to revitalize the water situation by constructing and upgrading water infrastructure in the community, thereby enhancing basic access to clean water for the majority of the population.
